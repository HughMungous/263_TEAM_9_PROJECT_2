Fix routing.Region.createPartitions():
    Current implementation generates a valid partition but this wont work well for larger regions as the distance between nodes in the subgraph is not accounted for. 

    The proposed fix for this is to sort the subgraphs according to their average squared radius from the centre of their longitude and latitude co-ordinates. 
    This allows us to generate a partition by favouring the most group subgraphs, and hence the partition is more optimal.

Implement a better ATSP algorithm():
    Currently, routing.Pathfinder only contains one algorithm - a depth 1 nearest neighbour implementation which is not very optimal by
    any standard. Implementing a better ATSP algorithm could potentially generate far better routes for each of our createPartitions
